Factor-X deficiency in amyloidosis: a critical review.

Greipp PR, Kyle RA, Bowie EJ.

Thirty cases of amyloidosis with factor-X deficiency, including six of our own,
were reviewed. Modest deficiency of factor X was often associated with severe
bleeding. In many of the cases, clinical bleeding could not be accounted for by
deficiency of factor X alone. Other hemostatic defects were found in these
patients and probably contributed to the bleeding. Modes of treatment, including 
the empiric use of corticosteroids and splenectomy, were discussed in light of
current knowledge of pathogenesis of this unusual blood clotting disorder. This
involves the interaction of amyloid fibrils and blood clotting factors.

[Clinical studies and immunology in acute myeloid leukemia during
chemo-immunotherapy].

[Article in German]

Lutz D.

14 patients with acute myeloid leukemia were treated with intermittent
chemo-immunotherapy for maintenance of remission. At monthly intervals, they
received 5 days of cytosine-arabinoside alternately combined with adriamycin or
thioguanine or cyclophosphamide or CCNU. Two weeks later, 2 x 10(9) unirradiated 
allogenic blasts mixed with 5-50 units neuraminidase/ml were injected
intradermally. Half the patients who had had many unfavourable prognostic factors
at the time of diagnosis relapsed within 15 months (average duration of 1st
remission 8 months). This result is comparable with the (past) results of
chemotherapy alone. Seven of the patients still in first remission have at
present reached an average remission duration of 17 months. Regular variations in
the blood cell counts, which depended on chemo- as well as immunotherapy, were
observed during the course of remission but not shortly before relapse. The
extent to which peripheral lymphocytes could be stimulated varied noticeably from
one patient to another and mostly increased with the progress of remission;
however, to date no correlation to the clinical course was evident.
